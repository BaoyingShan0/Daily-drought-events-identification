# Identify drought events on a daily scale (Daily SPI with removal and merging process)

## Introduction
This repository is to identify drought events on a daily scale, based on the daily SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index). 

## Requirements
- MATLAB

## Usage
See the main.m file for an example to apply this identification method, here is an example to show the process of identifying drought events. See more details of the removal and merging method: Shan, B., Verhoest, N. E. C., and De Baets, B.: Identification of compound drought and heatwave events on a daily scale and across four seasons, EGUsphere [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-147, 2023.
